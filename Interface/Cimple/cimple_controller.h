 * @brief Calculate (optimal) input that will be applied to take plant from current state (now) to target_cell.
 *
 * Global function to compute continuous control input for discrete transition.
 *
 * Computes continuous control input sequence which takes the plant:
 *
 *      - from now
 *      - to (chebyshev center of) target_cell
 *      => partitions given by discrete dynamics (d_dyn)
 *
 * Control input is calculated such that it minimizes:
 *
 *      f(x, u) = |Rx|_{ord} + |Qu|_{ord} + r'x + distance_error_weight * |xc - x(N)|_{ord}
 *      with xc == chebyshev center of target_cell
 *
 *    Notes
 *    =====
 *    1. The same horizon length as in reachability analysis
 *    should be used in order to guarantee feasibility.
 *
 *    2. If the closed loop algorithm has been used
 *    to compute reachability the input needs to be
 *    recalculated for each time step
 *    (with decreasing horizon length).
 *
 *    In this case only u(0) should be used as
 *    a control signal and u(1) ... u(N-1) discarded.
 *
 *    3. The "conservative" calculation makes sure that
 *    the plant remains inside the convex hull of the
 *    starting region during execution, i.e.::
 *
 *    x(1), x(2) ...  x(N-1) are in starting region.
 *
 *    If the original proposition preserving partition
 *    is not convex, then safety cannot be guaranteed.
